# PHSA-Insteon-Gateway

The project is about Home Automation. I have some devices that are Insteon-based.

Insteon uses a proprietary protocol to make the devices communicate wirelessly together, in a mesh topology. Here are examples: Dimmer Module, On/off Module, Dimmer Switch, On/off Switch, Dimmer Keypad (by 8 or by 6), Thermostat, Motion detector, ...

The goal of this project is to build a gateway betwen Insteon world and a generic MQTT broker, over IP BUT WITHOUT dependency to Insteon Cloud
